# Performance Optimization Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Bundle Size Optimization**
- ✅ Dynamic imports for heavy chart components
- ✅ Lazy loading of StudentStatus and StudentAssessment components
- ✅ Optimized webpack bundle splitting
- ✅ Removed unused CSS imports

### 2. **Next.js Configuration**
- ✅ Added Turbo mode for faster development builds
- ✅ Optimized package imports for react-icons and chart libraries
- ✅ Enhanced webpack configuration for better chunk splitting
- ✅ Development-specific optimizations

### 3. **Code Splitting**
- ✅ Chart.js components loaded only when needed
- ✅ Heavy components dynamically imported
- ✅ Chart configuration loaded asynchronously

## Performance Improvements Expected

### Development Mode
- **Before**: 9.5s, 4.5s, 4.1s, 2.1s compilation times
- **After**: Expected 2-3s compilation times (60-70% improvement)

### Production Build
- Smaller initial bundle size
- Faster page loads
- Better caching with chunk splitting

## Usage

### Development
```bash
# Use the optimized dev script
npm run dev

# Or use the fast dev script with additional optimizations
npm run dev:fast
```

### Performance Monitoring
- Performance metrics are logged to console in development mode
- Monitor bundle size with: `npm run analyze`

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. **Further Optimizations**
- Consider using React.memo() for expensive components
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Use React.lazy() for route-based code splitting

### 2. **Database Optimization**
- Add database indexes for frequently queried fields
- Implement query result caching
- Use database connection pooling

### 3. **API Optimization**
- Implement response caching
- Add request debouncing
- Use pagination for large datasets

### 4. **Image Optimization**
- Use Next.js Image component
- Implement lazy loading for images
- Optimize image formats (WebP, AVIF)

## Monitoring

The PerformanceMonitor component tracks:
- DOM Content Loaded time
- Load Complete time
- Total Load Time

Check browser console for performance metrics in development mode.
