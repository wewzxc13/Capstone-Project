# System Log Login/Logout Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Login Logging Issues
- **Problem**: Login.php only logged login if no login record existed for the day, preventing multiple login sessions
- **Fix**: Removed the daily restriction and now logs every successful login
- **File**: `API/login.php`

### 2. Logout Logging Issues
- **Problem**: Multiple logout events could fire (manual logout, beforeunload, visibility change) causing duplicates
- **Problem**: Restrictive 5-minute duplicate prevention was too long
- **Problem**: Required login record for "today" was too restrictive
- **Problem**: **NEW**: Logout events were firing immediately after login (within seconds)
- **Fix**: 
  - Reduced duplicate prevention from 5 minutes to 2 minutes
  - Changed login requirement from "today" to "within 24 hours"
  - Added better duplicate prevention logic
  - **NEW**: Added 30-second buffer to prevent immediate logout after login

### 3. Session Management Issues
- **Problem**: No proper tracking of active sessions vs. logout events
- **Problem**: **NEW**: Event listeners were firing too aggressively during page load
- **Fix**: Added timestamp-based logout tracking and better flag management
- **Fix**: **NEW**: Added login timestamp tracking and delayed event listener activation

## Changes Made

### API/Logs/create_system_log.php
- Added user validation to ensure user exists and is active
- Reduced duplicate logout prevention from 5 minutes to 2 minutes
- Changed login requirement from daily to 24-hour window
- Added comprehensive error logging for debugging
- Added user existence validation
- **NEW**: Added server-side check to prevent logout within 30 seconds of login

### API/login.php
- Removed daily login restriction
- Now logs every successful login attempt
- Maintains error handling for logging failures

### app/Topbar/Topbar.js
- Added timestamp-based logout tracking
- Improved beforeunload and visibility change handlers
- Better duplicate prevention logic
- More robust flag management
- **NEW**: Added 30-second buffer after login before allowing logout events
- **NEW**: Added `recentLogin` flag to prevent immediate logout events
- **NEW**: Improved event listener management to only activate after user is fully logged in

## New Features

### 1. Timestamp-Based Logout Tracking
- Stores logout timestamp in localStorage
- Prevents multiple logout logs within 5 minutes
- More intelligent duplicate prevention

### 2. Better Validation
- Validates user exists and is active before logging
- Better error handling and logging
- Input sanitization improvements

### 3. Debugging Support
- Added test script: `test_system_logs.php`
- Added fix verification script: `test_login_logout_fix.php`
- Comprehensive error logging
- Better error messages

### 4. **NEW: Immediate Logout Prevention**
- 30-second buffer after login before allowing logout events
- Frontend and backend validation
- Prevents the issue where logout events fire immediately after login

## Testing

Use the test scripts to verify functionality:

### Basic System Test
```
http://localhost/capstone-project/Logs/test_system_logs.php
```

### Login/Logout Fix Verification
```
http://localhost/capstone-project/Logs/test_login_logout_fix.php
```

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Session Tracking**: Every login and logout is properly recorded
2. **Reduced Duplicates**: Intelligent duplicate prevention without being too restrictive
3. **Better User Experience**: Users can have multiple sessions per day
4. **Improved Debugging**: Better error logging and validation
5. **Robust Handling**: Better handling of edge cases and browser events
6. **NEW**: **No More Immediate Logouts**: Prevents logout events from firing right after login

## Notes

- Login records are now created for every successful login
- Logout records require a recent login (within 24 hours) to prevent orphaned records
- Duplicate logout prevention is now 2 minutes instead of 5 minutes
- Browser close/tab switch logout logging is more intelligent
- **NEW**: All operations are logged for debugging purposes
- **NEW**: 30-second buffer prevents immediate logout events after login
- **NEW**: Event listeners are only activated after user is fully authenticated

## Technical Details

### Frontend Protection
- `recentLogin` flag set for 30 seconds after login
- Event listeners only activate after user data is loaded
- Manual logout checks for recent login status

### Backend Protection
- Server-side validation prevents logout within 30 seconds of login
- Database query checks most recent login timestamp
- Returns error if logout attempt is too close to login

### Event Listener Management
- `beforeunload` and `visibilitychange` listeners only added after authentication
- Proper cleanup when component unmounts
- Dependency on `userData` ensures listeners are properly managed
