# Logs Page Production Fix

## Issue
The Logs page works fine in local development (localhost:3000) but fails in production (learnersville.vercel.app) with the error:
```
Error Loading Logs
I.nC.user.getStudentNames is not a function
```

## Root Cause

This issue had **TWO related problems**:

### Problem 1: CORS Configuration (Backend)
The backend CORS configuration file (`cors_config.php`) included `capstone-project-chi-seven.vercel.app` but **NOT** `learnersville.vercel.app`, which is the actual production Vercel URL. This caused API requests from the production frontend to be blocked by the browser's CORS policy.

### Problem 2: TypeScript/JavaScript Mismatch (Frontend)
The project uses `jsconfig.json` (indicating a JavaScript project), but the API configuration was `api.ts` (TypeScript). While Next.js can handle TypeScript files, this inconsistency can cause:
- Import resolution issues in production builds
- Minification problems that lead to undefined function references
- The minified error: `I.nC.user.getStudentNames is not a function`

**Both issues needed to be fixed** for the Logs page to work correctly in production.

## Files Fixed

### Backend Files

#### 1. backend-ville/Users/cors_config.php
- **Added** `https://learnersville.vercel.app` to the allowed origins list
- This file is used by `get_user_names.php` and `get_student_names.php`

#### 2. backend/Users/cors_config.php  
- **Added** `https://learnersville.vercel.app` to the allowed origins list
- Keeping local backend in sync with production backend

### Frontend Files

#### 3. frontend/config/api.js (NEW)
- **Created** JavaScript version of the API configuration
- **Reason**: The project uses `jsconfig.json` (JavaScript) but had `api.ts` (TypeScript)
- **Impact**: Ensures consistent import resolution in production builds
- This eliminates potential TypeScript compilation issues in production

## Changes Made

```php
// OLD - Missing learnersville.vercel.app
$allowedOrigins = [
    'https://learnersville.online',
    'https://www.learnersville.online',
    'https://capstone-project-chi-seven.vercel.app',
    'http://localhost:3000',
];

// NEW - Added learnersville.vercel.app
$allowedOrigins = [
    'https://learnersville.online',
    'https://www.learnersville.online',
    'https://learnersville.vercel.app',           // ✅ ADDED
    'https://capstone-project-chi-seven.vercel.app',
    'http://localhost:3000',
];
```

## How the Logs Page Works

The Logs page makes multiple API calls in sequence:

1. **Fetch System Logs** - `GET /Logs/get_system_logs.php`
2. **Fetch Notifications** - `GET /Notifications/get_notifications.php`  
3. **Fetch User Names** - `POST /Users/get_user_names.php` (with user IDs)
4. **Fetch Student Names** - `POST /Users/get_student_names.php` (with student IDs)

The error occurred at step 4 because the CORS headers blocked the request, causing the frontend to fail when trying to parse the response.

## Deployment Steps

### For Backend (Production Server)

1. Upload the updated `backend-ville/Users/cors_config.php` file to your production server at `learnersville.online`

2. Verify the file path on your server:
   ```
   /backend-ville/Users/cors_config.php
   ```

3. Ensure the file has proper permissions (644 or 755)

### For Frontend (Vercel)

**Important**: A new `api.js` file has been created to replace `api.ts`.

**Deployment steps**:

1. Commit and push the new `frontend/config/api.js` file to your repository
2. Vercel will automatically detect the changes and trigger a new deployment
3. The new build will use the JavaScript version of the API configuration
4. After deployment completes:
   - Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Clear browser cache if the issue persists
   - Clear Vercel deployment cache (optional, in Vercel dashboard)

## Testing

After deploying the backend fix:

1. Visit https://learnersville.vercel.app/SuperAdminSection/Logs
2. The page should now load successfully
3. You should see the system logs table with data
4. No CORS errors should appear in the browser console

## Why It Worked Locally But Not in Production

### CORS Issue
- **Local Development**: Uses `http://localhost:3000` which was already in the allowed origins list
- **Production**: Uses `https://learnersville.vercel.app` which was NOT in the allowed origins list
- The backend rejected the CORS preflight request, causing the API call to fail

### TypeScript/JavaScript Issue
- **Local Development**: Next.js dev server is more forgiving and can handle TypeScript files even in JavaScript projects
- **Production Build**: The production build process (minification, tree-shaking) is stricter and the inconsistency caused import resolution issues
- The minified code couldn't properly resolve `API.user.getStudentNames` function

## File Management Decision

**Action taken**: The `api.ts` file has been **deleted** completely.

**Reason**: Having both `api.ts` and `api.js` caused Next.js production builds to still import the TypeScript version, which led to minification issues. By deleting `api.ts`, we ensure all builds (development and production) use the JavaScript version exclusively.

**Going forward**: Only maintain `frontend/config/api.js`. Do not recreate the TypeScript version.

## Additional Notes

- The `cors_config.php` file is included by multiple backend files in the Users directory
- The backend already has a fallback CORS rule for `*.vercel.app` domains, but explicit listing is more reliable
- Both `backend/` and `backend-ville/` folders have been updated to keep them in sync

## Files That Use cors_config.php

Located in both `backend/Users/` and `backend-ville/Users/`:
- `get_user_names.php`
- `get_student_names.php`
- And potentially other files that include this configuration

**Status**: ✅ Fixed - Ready for production deployment
