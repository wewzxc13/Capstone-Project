# System Logs CORS Fix for Production

## Problem
The `create_system_log.php` file had hardcoded CORS headers that only allowed `localhost` origins, preventing production requests from `https://learnersville.online` and Vercel deployments from working.

### Error Messages
```
Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at 
https://learnersville.online/backend-ville/Logs/create_system_log.php. 
(Reason: CORS header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' does not match 'http://localhost:3000').
```

## Root Cause
The file was setting its own CORS headers BEFORE including `connection.php`, which meant the hardcoded localhost-only headers overrode the proper production-ready CORS configuration that exists in `connection.php`.

## Solution
Removed hardcoded CORS headers from `create_system_log.php` and let `connection.php` handle all CORS configuration.

### Files Modified

#### 1. `backend/Logs/create_system_log.php`
- **Removed**: Hardcoded CORS headers (lines 2-16)
- **Result**: Now uses CORS configuration from `connection.php`

#### 2. `backend-ville/Logs/create_system_log.php`
- **Removed**: Hardcoded CORS headers (lines 2-16)
- **Result**: Now uses CORS configuration from `connection.php`

#### 3. `backend/connection.php`
- **Added**: Support for Vercel deployments (`*.vercel.app`)
- **Result**: Consistent CORS handling with backend-ville

## Supported Origins (Now Working)
✅ `http://localhost:3000` - Local development
✅ `http://localhost:3001` - Additional dev port
✅ `http://localhost:3002` - Additional dev port
✅ `https://learnersville.online` - Production (HTTPS)
✅ `http://learnersville.online` - Production (HTTP)
✅ `https://*.vercel.app` - Vercel preview/production deployments

## Changes Summary

### Before (Hardcoded CORS - Only Localhost)
```php
<?php
// Dynamic CORS for localhost:3000+
$origin = $_SERVER['HTTP_ORIGIN'] ?? '';
if (preg_match('/^http:\/\/localhost:3[0-9]{3,}$/', $origin)) {
    header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: $origin");
} else {
    header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:3000"); // fallback
}
header("Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS");
header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization");
header("Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true");

if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'OPTIONS') {
    http_response_code(200);
    exit();
}

include_once '../connection.php';
```

### After (Uses Production-Ready CORS)
```php
<?php
// CORS headers are handled in connection.php which supports production domains
include_once '../connection.php';
```

## Testing
1. **Local Development**: System logs should work from `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Production**: System logs should work from `https://learnersville.online`
3. **Vercel**: System logs should work from any `*.vercel.app` deployment

## Deployment Instructions

### For Production Server (learnersville.online)
1. Upload the updated files to the server:
   - `backend-ville/Logs/create_system_log.php`
   - `backend-ville/connection.php`

2. Verify CORS is working by testing login/logout from production frontend

### Testing the Fix
```bash
# Test from production frontend
# 1. Open https://learnersville.online
# 2. Login with valid credentials
# 3. Check browser console - should see no CORS errors
# 4. Verify system log is created in database
```

## Additional Notes
- The `connection.php` file already had proper CORS configuration
- The issue was that `create_system_log.php` was overriding it
- All other files in the Logs directory already use `connection.php` properly
- No other files needed fixing

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Ready for deployment to production
