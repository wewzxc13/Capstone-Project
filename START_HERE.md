## ⚡ TL;DR - The Absolute Minimum

### Backend (Namecheap):
1. Create MySQL database in cPanel
2. Import `database/dblearnsville.sql`
3. Create `.env` file (use `backend/ENV_EXAMPLE.txt`)
4. Upload backend files via FTP to `/public_html/backend-ville/`
5. Set permissions: folders 755, files 644, .env 600

### Frontend (Vercel):
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Import to Vercel (vercel.com)
3. Add environment variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_PATH=/backend-ville`
4. Click Deploy
5. Update backend `.env` with Vercel URL

**Total Time:** ~20-30 minutes (excluding DNS propagation)

## 🛠️ What You'll Need

### Accounts Required:
- ✅ Namecheap hosting account (backend)
- ✅ Vercel account (frontend - free tier is fine)
- ✅ GitHub account (for Vercel deployment)

### Software to Install:
- ✅ FTP client (FileZilla - free)
- ✅ Git (if not already installed)
- ✅ Text editor (VS Code, Notepad++, etc.)

### Information to Gather:
- ✅ Namecheap cPanel login
- ✅ FTP credentials (from cPanel)
- ✅ Your domain name
- ✅ GitHub repository URL

---

## 📋 Before You Start

### Step 1: Test Locally
Make sure everything works on your local machine:
- [ ] Application runs without errors
- [ ] Database connects properly
- [ ] All features work as expected
- [ ] No console errors (press F12 in browser)

### Step 2: Gather Credentials
You'll need these during deployment:

**For Backend (Namecheap):**
- cPanel URL: `yourdomain.com/cpanel`
- cPanel username: ___________________
- cPanel password: ___________________
- FTP host: `ftp.yourdomain.com`
- FTP username: ___________________
- FTP password: ___________________

**For Frontend (Vercel):**
- GitHub username: ___________________
- GitHub repository: ___________________
- Vercel email: ___________________

### Step 3: Backup Everything
Before deployment, create backups:
- [ ] Database backup (export from phpMyAdmin)
- [ ] Code backup (commit to Git)
- [ ] Local .env file (save securely)

---

## 🎯 Deployment Overview

### Phase 1: Backend to Namecheap (15-20 minutes)
```
Database Setup → File Preparation → Upload → Configure → Test
```
**Result:** Backend accessible at `https://yourdomain.com/backend-ville/`

### Phase 2: Frontend to Vercel (5-10 minutes)
```
Push to GitHub → Import to Vercel → Configure → Deploy → Test
```
**Result:** Frontend accessible at `https://your-project.vercel.app`

### Phase 3: Integration (5 minutes)
```
Update CORS → Test Connection → Verify Features
```
**Result:** Frontend and backend communicating successfully

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|---------|------|
| Upload .git folder to server | Use FTP to upload only necessary files |
| Use same password for everything | Generate strong, unique passwords |
| Skip .env file | Always create and configure .env |
| Forget to set permissions | Set correct permissions immediately |
| Skip testing after deployment | Test thoroughly before announcing |
| Commit .env to Git | Add .env to .gitignore |
| Use HTTP | Always use HTTPS in production |
| Deploy with debug mode on | Set ENVIRONMENT=production |
